              <h2>Context</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                Quora is a Q&A platform with the mission of sharing and growing the
                world's knowledge. Quora works by continuously learning the interests
                of users based on their activity on the platform, and then suggesting
                content to them with the home feed and "digest" emails. During the
                summer of 2019, I interned as a product designer on the
                internationalization (i18n) team.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom--xlarge">

              <h2 class="">New User Lifecycle</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom--large">
                One of my first projects at Quora was to explore the process of how
                new users encounter Quora and identify points where
                dropoff occurs. In order to understand the steps involved from first
                encountering Quora to becoming a power user, I documented each step of
                the signup/onboarding flow as well as the initial actions that are taken
                by new users. I also met with user researchers, data scientists,
                and other product designers at the company to learn from their
                collective experiences. With this information, I created a lifecycle
                diagram illustrating the most common flows of new users.
              </p>
            </div>

            <img src="images/quora-new-user-lifecycle.png" alt="New user lifecycle flowchart for Quora" class="full-img spacing-bottom--large">

            <div class="container">
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                There are two main ways new users sign up for Quora: we referred to
                these as SEO and organic. The SEO (search engine optimization) flow
                generally involves people making a Google search and then clicking a
                Quora link in the search results. While the user can read content on
                the link they clicked, they must create an account or sign in to view
                related questions. This signup wall often leads to frustration and low
                intent when new users create their accounts as many simply want to
                view the link they had just clicked on. As this SEO flow accounted for
                the majority of new users on the platform, new users often created
                accounts which quickly became stale.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom--xlarge">
                New (SEO) users have low intent when creating their accounts
              </p>

              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                In order for users to get the most out of Quora and find content that
                matches their interests, they must complete the onboarding flow
                and follow topics. As these users often have low intent when going
                through the onboarding steps, a majority of these new users follow the
                minimum number of topics and don't accurately select what interests them.
                This leads to two main problems&mdash;users end up with a home feed of
                content they don't care for, or only see content that is far too
                specific to a particular topic.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point">
                1. &nbsp;New user feeds are too siloed around particular topics
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom--xlarge">
                2. &nbsp;Low intent follow actions lead to a cluttered home feed
              </p>
              <h2 class="spacing-bottom">Content Sources</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                At the core of the two problems is the question: how do users discover
                new content sources after they sign up? Content sources on Quora refer
                to topics, spaces (Quora's version of a subreddit or Facebook group),
                and other users who post and like content.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom--large">
                How do users discover new content sources?
              </p>
              <h4>1. Discovery Carousel</h4>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                One of the main ways users find new topics and spaces to follow is
                through discovery carousels which are placed in the home feed.
              </p>
              <div class="row spacing-bottom--large">
                <div class="col-sm-6">

              </div>
              <h4>2. Search</h4>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                Users also directly search for specific topics, spaces, and users.
                However, unlike similar applications such as Twitter or LinkedIn,
                Quora's search page is initially empty.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom">
                While similar applications use the search page as a way to surface
                new content, Quora's search page is empty
              </p>
              <div class="row spacing-bottom--xlarge">
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <p>Quora</p>

              </div>

              <h2>Goal</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                Improve the discoverability of quality content sources through
                redesigning the mobile search page.
              </p>
              <h4>Priority Metrics and KPIs</h4>
              <p class="spacing-bottom--xlarge">
                Active hours (sessions per day), trending content taps, topic and space follows
              </p>

              <h2>Approach 1: Discovery</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                The first approach focuses on grouping the discovery carousels in
                one place, allowing users to easily find new topics, spaces, and users
                to follow. While having a dedicated page for the carousels may increase
                the number of content sources a user follows, simply showing
                suggestions of content sources to follow isn't valuable for users. For
                this reason, approach #2 focuses more on surfacing actual content
                that the user may be interested in.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom--large">
                People don't necessarily want to follow more content sources&mdash;
                they to want to see better content when they use Quora
              </p>
              <div class="row spacing-bottom--xlarge">
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <img src="images/quora-discover-1.png" alt="First mockup of new discover page" class="full-img">

              </div>

              <h2>Approach 2: Trending Content</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                The second approach I tried was to create a separate feed where users
                can find content that may not have entered their home feed. The idea
                with showing trending content is that users can first see the stories
                (question and answer pair) related to a particular content source before actually
                following that source.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom--large">
                Showing trending content lets users view engaging stories before
                following the content sources
              </p>
              <div class="row spacing-bottom--xlarge">
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                  <img src="images/quora-trending-1.png" alt="First mockup of new trending page" class="full-img">
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4 hide-on-mobile">
                  <img src="images/quora-trending-2.png" alt="Second mockup of new trending page" class="full-img">
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4 hide-on-mobile">

              </div>

              <h2>Story Card</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                The first step to designing the trending feed is thinking through how
                each story (question and answer pair) will be presented. Since there's
                a limited amount of space on the screen especially if they keyboard is
                up, I designed the trending card to take less vertical space by moving
                the author information to the top and removing their picture/credential.
                As the purpose of the explore page is to highlight new content,
                moving the author information puts the focus back to the questions and
                answers.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point">
                The trending card is 22% shorter than the home feed card, allowing
                more stories to be shown in the limited available space
              </p>
              <div class="row spacing-bottom--small">
                <div class="col-xs-6"><h4>Home Feed Card</h4></div>
                <div class="col-xs-6"><h4>Trending Card</h4></div>
              </div>
              <img src="images/quora-cards-comparison.png" alt="The new card is 22% shorter than the old" class="full-img spacing-bottom--xlarge">

              <h2>Search Interaction</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom--large">
                Another important consideration was deciding whether to open the
                keyboard when the user taps the search icon from the home page. On one
                hand, showing the full page without the keyboard would likely increase
                engagement with the new trending content feature with the tradeoff of
                requiring an extra tap to enter a search query. The other option of
                showing the keyboard right away aligns with the intent of users
                looking to enter a query, however reduces potential interaction with
                the new trending feed.
              </p>
              <img src="images/quora-search-interaction.png" alt="Diagram illustrating whether the keyboard should open when the user taps search" class="full-img spacing-bottom--large">
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                After discussion with the team as well as looking at data of search
                usage, we decided to go with option 1 (open the keyboard immediately).
                This way, the trending content is still visible when opening the
                search page, however does not interupt those who want to enter a
                search right away.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom--xlarge">
                We chose option 1 to ensure the new feature doesn't hinder those who
                simply want to make a search
              </p>

              <h2>Final Designs</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom--large">
                The explore page gives users a way to break out of their home feed and
                discover new content that matches their interests. With the trending
                topics, users can view a curated list of related stories while also
                being able to read globally trending content on the platform.

                In order to produce a more realistic prototype and assess the
                engineering work required to build this feature, I developed a working
                prototype during Quora's internal hackathon using the company's web
                framework (Python + Webnode). The logic behind the ranking algorithm
                of stories was built by two engineers and two data scientists I was
                working with.

              <h2>Results</h2>
              <p class="spacing-bottom">
                After developing the prototype above, our team won the company's internal
                hackathon, sparking an initiative to build this feature with a larger
                engineering team dedicated to it.
              </p>
              <p class="main-point">
                The prototype won first place in company hackathon
              </p>
              <p class="main-point spacing-bottom--xlarge">
                The trending/explore page project is now being prioritized and the
